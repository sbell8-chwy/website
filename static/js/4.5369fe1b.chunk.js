You know what it's more fun than it sounds.\nIt's kinda like Civilisation without the land areas, or worries about being attacked, or graphics.\nYou know what, just go look for yourself.\n\nIt actually has really deep science and resource trees and can be fun to play if you're into that sort of thing.\nThe problem is that to play it normally takes way more direct attention than I can give it during a work day.\nI can't be constantly checking to make sure my resources aren't stuck at their limits or worried I'm going to miss some event that I only get a short window to click on.\nRather than give it up so easily I thought: 'This is a browser game, I should be able to automate this.'\n\nNot wanting to reinvent the wheel I fired up [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) and went to see what was out there.\nI found a [Kitten Tools](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/29244-kittens-tools) script and gave it a try.\nThe script wasn't bad.\nIt converted resources as needed when they hit their limits, which was my main concern.\nHowever it bought a lot of buildings I didn't necessary want right at that time, and it converted all my catnip just before winter killing all of my kittens.\nSo on the whole it maybe could have been a bit better.\n\nThe best thing it did was to save me a lot of time figuring out how to interact with the game.\nI now had a bunch of example code for processing resources, checking statuses, performing actions, and jumping off point to better explore the API of the game.\n\nSo in bits and spurts I'll be building up a script that works better.\nAs I learn more about the game I'll also be able to give it better decision making and options.\nHopefully by the next blog post I'll have something workable and maybe I'll post a version to [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org)\n"}}});
