### Building This Site. Part 1

This site is really just for me to have a place to play around. Building it as a blog gives me a reason to keep revisiting it and making improvements. It will also serve as a convienent place to keep an online resume. My plan is to post about once a month. With that out of the way let's move on to what I used to build this site.

I wanted to use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) in large part due to it's current popularity and because it appears to be a well done component framework. To get started I used Facebook's own [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool which I highly recommend to anybody just getting started with react, and possibly to those already familiar with it.
